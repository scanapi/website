# Run ScanAPI

It’s time to make ScanAPI work! Create a new directory for ScanAPI files and name it whatever you
want. Through the rest of this tutorial we’ll refer to this directory as **root**.

For example:

```shell
$ mkdir scanapi
```

Let’s add your ScanAPI spec. Create `scanapi.yaml` in root with the following content:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: snippets-api
    path: http://demo.scanapi.dev/api/v1/
    headers:
      Content-Type: application/json
    requests:
      - name: health
        method: get
        path: /health/
```

The folder structure should look like this now:

```
- scanapi (root directory)
  - scanapi.yaml
```

And let's run ScanAPI, so it will hit and document the specified endpoint:

```shell
$ scanapi run
```

From the output of the command, you can see that ScanAPI:

```shell
Loading file scanapi.yaml # loads the specification file you created
Writing documentation # starts writing the report for your API
Making request GET http://demo.scanapi.dev/api/v1/health/ # makes a GET request to the /health path

The documentation was generated successfully.
It is available at <your_root_path>/scanapi-report.html # generates the API documentation
```

It is time to check the results! Open the generated file `scanapi-report.html` in your browser.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/assets/images/tutorial/page3/report-1.png"
    width="900"
    alt="An overview screenshot of the report."
  >
</p>

Collapse the request component to see more details. First, the details of the request itself:

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/assets/images/tutorial/page3/report-2.png"
    width="900"
    alt="Request details"
  >
</p>

The cURL section helps you to simulate manually the same request using the command line. You can
copy its content and run it in your terminal to see the same results:

```shell
curl -X GET \
-H "User-Agent: python-requests/2.24.0" \
-H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate" \
-H "Accept: */*" \
-H "Connection: keep-alive" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d 'None' http://demo.scanapi.dev/api/v1/health/ --compressed
```

And then, the response details:

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/assets/images/tutorial/page3/report-3.png"
    width="900"
    alt="Response details"
  >
</p>

The content section shows probably what you were searching for, the content result of you request:

```
"OK"!
```

Note that `TESTS` is empty for now. This happens because we did not write any tests for the request
yet. Let's solve it, let's write some tests!
