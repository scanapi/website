# Add to Project

Let's say that you have your own API and you want to run ScanAPI on your pipeline to test it.
This is the scenario:

- \- Every time a code is merged into the `main` branch, the API is deployed on staging environment.
  Ex: `https://your-api.staging.com`
- \- Right after the previously deploy is done, you want to run ScanAPI against your staging API.

> It is not recommended to run ScanAPI directly on production, since it hits the API's endpoints and
> it will, in fact, change the production database if any write operation is performed. If you still
> want/need to test your API on production environment, we encourage to use specific test accounts
> for that.

This is the folder structure:

```
- your_api (directory containing all files of your API)
|‚îÄ‚îÄ api_file_1
|‚îÄ‚îÄ api_file_2
|‚îÄ‚îÄ api_file_3
|‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
|___  scanapi
      |‚îÄ‚îÄ csv_template.jinja
      |‚îÄ‚îÄ scanapi-report.csv
      |‚îÄ‚îÄ scanapi-report.html
      |‚îÄ‚îÄ scanapi.conf
      |___  scanapi.yaml
```

Let's see how to implement this pipeline using two different CI options:

- \- [GitHub Action][gh-actions]
- \- [CircleCI][circle-ci]

## GitHub Action

Assuming that you have already your API's code in a GitHub repository, the first step is to create
a new file in the `.github/workflows` directory named `scanapi-action.yaml`. The folder structure
should look like this:

```
- your_api (directory containing all files of your API)
|‚îÄ‚îÄ .github
¬†¬†  |___  workflows
¬†¬†      |___  scanapi-action.yaml
|‚îÄ‚îÄ api_file_1
|‚îÄ‚îÄ api_file_2
|‚îÄ‚îÄ api_file_3
|‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
|___  scanapi
      |‚îÄ‚îÄ csv_template.jinja
      |‚îÄ‚îÄ scanapi-report.csv
      |‚îÄ‚îÄ scanapi-report.html
      |‚îÄ‚îÄ scanapi.conf
      |___  scanapi.yaml
```

Copy the following YAML contents into the `scanapi-action.yaml` file:

```yaml
{% raw %}name: Document and Test
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy-on-staging:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Your staging deploy action here!"
  scanapi:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run automated API tests
        uses: scanapi/github-action@v1
        with:
          scanapi_version: '==2.3.0'
          arguments: run ./scanapi/scanapi.yaml -c ./scanapi/scanapi.conf -o ./scanapi/scanapi-report.html
      - name: Upload scanapi-report.html
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        if: ${{ always() }}
        with:
          name: ScanAPI Report
          path: ./scanapi/scanapi-report.html
    needs: [deploy-on-staging]{% endraw %}
```

If you would try to run this action, you would receive the following error:

```shell
Error to make request `http://demo.scanapi.dev/api/v1/rest-auth/login/`.
'USER' environment variable not set or badly configured
```

This happens because you didn't set the environment variables `USER` and `PASSWORD` in your
GitHub repository. Follow these steps to create the missing env vars:

> [https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets)

Now, let's change `scanapi-action.yaml` to access the secrets you've just created:

```yaml
{% raw %}name: Document and Test
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy-on-staging:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Your staging deploy action here!"
  scanapi:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run automated API tests
        uses: scanapi/github-action@v1
        env:
          USER: ${{ secrets.USER }} # this is new
          PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }} # this is new
        with:
          scanapi_version: '==2.3.0'
          arguments: run ./scanapi/scanapi.yaml -c ./scanapi/scanapi.conf -o ./scanapi/scanapi-report.html
      - name: Upload scanapi-report.html
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        if: ${{ always() }}
        with:
          name: ScanAPI Report
          path: ./scanapi/scanapi-report.html
    needs: [deploy-on-staging]{% endraw %}
```

It is time to run your action, it should work now! üéâ

    width="900"
    alt="GitHub Action Overview"

</p>

Note that the `scanapi` job only starts after the `deploy-on-staging` ends:

    width="900"
    alt="GitHub Action Pipeline"

</p>

Inside the `Artifacts` section, click in the `ScanAPI Report` to access the results:

  <img
    src="/assets/images/tutorial/step13/github-action-artifacts.png"
    width="900"
    alt="GitHub Action Artifacts"
  >
</p>

> Usually, it is recommend to have a separated file with the deploy job. We kept it inside the
> scanapi action for demo purposes.

## CircleCI

Assuming that you API's code is in a GitHub/Bitbucket repository and you have already a
[CircleCI Account][circle-ci], create a new file in the `.circleci` directory named `config.yml`.
The folder structure should look like this:

```
- your_api (directory containing all files of your API)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .circleci
 ¬†¬† |___  config.yml
|‚îÄ‚îÄ api_file_1
|‚îÄ‚îÄ api_file_2
|‚îÄ‚îÄ api_file_3
|‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
|___  scanapi
      |‚îÄ‚îÄ csv_template.jinja
      |‚îÄ‚îÄ scanapi-report.csv
      |‚îÄ‚îÄ scanapi-report.html
      |‚îÄ‚îÄ scanapi.conf
      |___  scanapi.yaml
```

Copy the following YAML contents into the `config.yml` file:

```yaml
{% raw %}version: 2.1

workflows:
  main:
    jobs:
      - deploy-on-staging:
          filters:
              branches:
                only:
                  - main
      - scanapi:
          requires:
            - deploy-on-staging
          filters:
            branches:
              only:
                - main

jobs:
  deploy-on-staging:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:14.10.1
    steps:
      - run: echo "Your staging deploy job here!"
  scanapi:
    docker:
      - image: camilamaia/scanapi:2.3.0
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Run ScanAPI
          command: |
            scanapi run scanapi/scanapi.yaml -c scanapi/scanapi.conf -o scanapi/report.html
      - store_artifacts:
          path: scanapi/report.html{% endraw %}
```

Save, commit and push your changes to your `main` branch.
[Setup your repo into CircleCI][circle-ci-setup], using the already using the already created
`config.yml` file.

    src="/assets/images/tutorial/step13/circleci-setup.png"
    width="400"
    alt="CircleCi Setup"
  >
</p>

If you would try to run this workflow, you would receive the following error:

```shell
Error to make request `http://demo.scanapi.dev/api/v1/rest-auth/login/`.
'USER' environment variable not set or badly configured
```

This happens because you didn't set the environment variables `USER` and `PASSWORD` in your
CircleCI Project. Follow these steps to create the missing env vars:

> [https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project)

Now, let's change `scanapi-action.yaml` to access the env variables you've just created:

```yaml
{% raw %}version: 2.1

workflows:
  main:
    jobs:
      - deploy-on-staging:
          filters:
              branches:
                only:
                  - main
      - scanapi:
          requires:
            - deploy-on-staging
          filters:
            branches:
              only:
                - main

jobs:
  deploy-on-staging:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:14.10.1
    steps:
      - run: echo "Your staging deploy job here!"
  scanapi:
    docker:
      - image: camilamaia/scanapi:2.3.0
        environment:
            USER: $USER
            PASSWORD: $PASSWORD
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Run ScanAPI
          command: |
            scanapi run scanapi/scanapi.yaml -c scanapi/scanapi.conf -o scanapi/report.html
      - store_artifacts:
          path: scanapi/report.html{% endraw %}
```

It is time to run your workflow, it should work now! üéâ
Note that the `scanapi` job only starts after the `deploy-on-staging` ends:

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/assets/images/tutorial/step13/circleci-workflow-1.png"

  <img
    src="/assets/images/tutorial/step13/circleci-workflow-2.png"
    width="900"
    alt="CircleCI ScanAPI job"

</p>

Inside the `Artifacts` tab, click in the `scanapi/report.html` to access the results:

<p align="center">
