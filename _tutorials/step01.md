# Setup

Welcome to ScanAPI's tutorial! This tutorial will guide you on how to test and document an API using
ScanAPI.

## Installation

ScanAPI is a Python library. For installing ScanAPI, you will need:

- \- [python][python] version 3.6 or higher
- \- [pip][pip-installation], the standard package manager for Python

If you are new to the Python world, no worries, this
[Installation & Setup Guide][realpython-setup-guide] can help you with more detailed instructions.

With Python and pip installed, install ScanAPI from the terminal:

```shell
$ pip install scanapi
```

Check that ScanAPI is installed properly:

```shell
$ scanapi --version
scanapi, version 2.3.0
```

**macOS tip**: In case you are on a macOS machine and your `python --version` is 2.x, you will need to perform some extra steps [described here](https://dev.to/malwarebo/how-to-set-python3-as-a-default-python-version-on-mac-4jjf).

The output should return a version equal to 2.3.0 or higher.
